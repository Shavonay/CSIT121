            <h2> My HTML Journey - Labs 1 & 2</h2>
            <p><em>Published on February 12, 2025 by Shavonay Morgan</em></p>

        <p>Who knew that building a website could be so easy? Even though this is a simple website with little customization, I learned a lot about the basics of HTML and the structure of websites. I also learned that semantic elements such as "article," "section," and "main" are a great way to improve the readability and organization of a webpage. Additionally, the resources on W3Schools are extremely helpful, easy to follow, and are a great addition to the module notes and content. Overall, this assignment and the practice exercises made me more excited to learn more about HTML.</p>
