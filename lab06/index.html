        <h2 id="section3">How the Website is Organized</h2>
        <p><strong>How is the site organized?</strong> The site uses hierarchical organization, starting with a clearly defined homepage that directs users to major sections like “Donate,” “Get Help,” “Give Blood,” “Training & Certification, and "Volunteer." Navigation links are placed at the top of every page, allowing users to easily access key services. The structure is deep enough to group related content without overwhelming the user, and the design seems to follow the "three-click rule," where most information can be found within three clicks.</p>
        <p><strong>CRAP Principle Example:</strong> 
            <p>This website uses all of the CRAP principles and they are listed below.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The red buttons and headings stand out clearly against the white background, drawing attention to key actions or menu listings like "Donate Now."</li>
              <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The fonts, colors, and button styles are consistent throughout the site.</li>
              <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> All text and images are neatly aligned, creating an organized layout that improves the readability.</li>
              <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related content, like blood donation locations and scheduling options, is grouped for easier access rather than being separated into completely different sections. This helps users quickly find all the information they need in one place.</li>
            </ul>            
       </article>

        <h2 id="section4">Accessibility, Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Engagement</h2>
        <p><strong>Audit Score:</strong> According to the <a href="https://www.accessibilitychecker.org" target="_blank">Accessibility Checker</a>, the website's audit score is 69%.</p>
        <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> The site is very effective. The navigation includes key actions such as donating, volunteering, and giving blood, all of which are clearly labeled and easy to access from the top of the homepage. The buttons are large and descriptive, and they expand into related sections, making it easy for all users regardless of what they are looking for.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> <p> The site is efficient and easy to use. When users click on a section or option, such as scheduling a donation or volunteer opportunities, the experience is smooth and responsive. When returning to the homepage, the site keeps the user at the same position so they don’t lose their place or have to start over. This helps users stay focused and save time from scrolling to find their initial position, especially when browsing multiple sections. The overall layout and speed of the site support quick access to important features.</p>
        <p><strong>Engagement:</strong> <p> The website is visually engaging and uses a simple color scheme of red, white, and gray, which reflects the organization’s logo and overall brand identity. The site also uses images and icons effectively to guide users and keep their attention, making the experience more interactive. Photos, personal stories, and clear calls to action help users feel emotionally connected to the cause. The layout is easy to follow, and interactive features like donation scheduling keep users involved and engaged with the site’s purpose.</p>

        <h2 id="section5">Recommendation</h2>
        <p> One recommendation to improve the website is to address the accessibility issues identified by the audit, such as missing alternative texts for images and the lack of color contrast. Fixing these issues would make the website more inclusive for users who are using assistive technology such as screen readers or those with visual impairments.</p>
