            <p>EPUB is mostly used for digital books that people read on phones, tablets, laptops, or e-readers. It is one of the most common file types for eBooks because it changes to fit your screen, and it lets you change font size, brightness, or layout. A lot of library apps, free book websites, and reading platforms use EPUB, so it is easy to find and open. For example, you can download an EPUB from a library site, open it in Apple Books, and start reading right away. According to Lenovo, EPUB is popular because it works with most devices and apps, making it a flexible choice for readers (Lenovo, 2021).</p>

            <p>EPUB is also used in schools to make learning easier and more flexible for students. Teachers can add things like audio, images, or short videos right into the file, which helps explain topics better. For example, a history teacher might include a short video clip from a documentary or a map image next to the lesson text. A student who has trouble focusing could highlight key terms or take notes right in the EPUB file. According to Harman, EPUB readers also have tools like note-taking, bookmarking, and support for screen readers or text-to-speech (Harman, 2023).</p>

            <p>It is also used in workplaces and businesses for things like training manuals, onboarding packets, and company policies. A lot of companies like using EPUB because it is easy to share and update, and it works on phones, tablets, and computers. For example, a manager might send out an EPUB guide that includes short videos explaining new rules or steps for using company software. According to Gera, businesses can even track if employees are reading the material and use features like highlights or interactive check-ins (Gera, 2018). This makes EPUB a good choice when companies need something that looks professional but still works well on different devices.</p>
