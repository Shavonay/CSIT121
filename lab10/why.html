                    <p>EPUB is important because it makes it easier for people to read on screens. Older formats like PDFs do not adapt well, especially on phones, which makes reading harder. EPUB fixes this problem by letting the content adjust based on screen size. As the DAISY Consortium puts it, “it allows content to be displayed properly regardless of the size of the screen or device being used” (DAISY Consortium, 2020). It also supports font and background changes, so users can make it more comfortable to read, whether they're on a tablet or laptop.</p>

            <p>Another reason why EPUB is important is because of how it supports accessibility. It works with screen readers and gives users structure, like headings and links, to move through the text. According to DAISY Consortium: “It allows full navigation via screen readers and support for headings, links, and landmarks” (DAISY Consortium, 2020). That is useful for people with vision impairments or learning disabilities who rely on tools to access digital content. EPUB helps to make sure that more people can read the same materials in the way that works best for them.</p>

            <p>EPUB is also built to last. Since it is based on open web standards, it is not locked to one company or device. DAISY Consortium says that one of its strengths is “It works on any modern reading system, platform, or device” (DAISY Consortium, 2020). Publishers and writers do not have to worry about getting stuck in one system, and it supports images, audio, and even video. That makes EPUB one of the few digital formats that balances design freedom, accessibility, and flexibility all in one.</p>
