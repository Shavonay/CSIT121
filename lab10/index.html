            <p>Welcome to my website about EPUB, a digital publishing format used for eBooks and other electronic publications. EPUB is designed to be flexible and readable on many different devices, like phones, tablets, and eReaders. It adjusts to different screen sizes and lets users change text settings like font or size. This makes it easier and more comfortable to read compared to formats like PDF. On this site, you’ll find information about what EPUB is and why it’s a widely used standard today.</p>

            <p>This website is part of a project for my web development class, where we had to choose a W3C web standard to research and explain. I picked EPUB because it's something I use often outside of school when reading manuals, free books, or digital guides. I wanted to learn more about how it works and what makes it different from other file formats. Since it uses HTML, CSS, and XML, it also connects to things we’ve already studied in this course. It seemed like a good mix of something familiar and something new.</p>

            <p>Use the navigation menu to explore each section of the site. You can learn what EPUB is, why it matters, and how it's used by readers, authors, and developers. If you're interested in digital publishing, this project might help you understand the format behind many of the books you’ve read. Thanks for visiting my site, and I hope you learn something new!</p>
