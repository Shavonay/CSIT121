        <p>Who knew that building a website could be so easy? Even though this is a simple website with little customization, I learned a lot about the basics of HTML and the structure of websites. I also learned that semantic elements such as "article," "section," and "main" are a great way to improve the readability and organization of a webpage. Additionally, the resources on W3Schools are extremely helpful, easy to follow, and are a great addition to the module notes and content. Overall, this assignment and the practice exercises made me more excited to learn more about HTML.</p>
        <p>Since my last publication, I have learned about CSS and its <span class="importance">importance</span> in web development. I learned that CSS was created to solve the problem created after tags such as "font" were added to the HTML 3.2 specification. I also learned that CSS greatly simplifies the process of styling web pages with the use of external stylesheet files. In addition to the external stylesheet, CSS can be added to HTML using inline and embedded styles within the (style) tag. Overall, I liked exploring CSS and I hope to learn more.</p>
